- Revise/improve sub-agent instructions per best practices
- test/run-tests.js needs to NOT output to console.log if command line includes --silent
- run-and-fix-tests skill should:
  - Exit workflow after setting up configuration first time.
  - When exiting after setup, tell user to examine the build configuration and change as needed.
- FIXME: write-git-commit skill sometimes doesn't follow workflows. Needs stronger "guardrails" restored.
