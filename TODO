Immediate:
- Move git formatting for presentation to script instead of instructing LLM

Backlog:
- Some unit tests are probably overlapping and could be consolidated.
- FIXME: write-git-commit skill sometimes doesn't follow workflows. Needs stronger "guardrails" restored.
- Revise/improve sub-agent instructions per best practices
- run-and-fix-tests skill should:
  - Exit workflow after setting up configuration first time.
  - When exiting after setup, tell user to examine the build configuration and change as needed.
- run-and-fix-tests: Simplify
  - move agent delegation instructions in main skill. Just say "delegate to (sub-agent)" with instructions on what to pass to it.
  - remove / greatly reduce build-procedures and run-build reference files.
  - remove completion.md / simplify and move to main skill.
  - run-tests should reference sub-agent

Nice-to-Have:
- Feature: Run and Fix tests needs CI/CD mode that skips build/test output and just analyzes the failures directly (assuming they're available)
- Improve test line coverage > 90%
