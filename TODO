Immediate:
- Reference files need to have TOC / summary at top so agent knows to read whole file
- FIXME: reference files should not reference other reference files. Check all of them.

Backlog:
- Some unit tests are probably overlapping and could be consolidated.
- Run and fix tests "Customizing Configuration" secton might be in accurate. Build tool is always an array now.
- FIXME: write-git-commit skill sometimes doesn't follow workflows. Needs stronger "guardrails" restored.
  - move as much as you can to scripts as possible. I.e. formatting for presentation
- Rename "settings.plugins.run-and-fix-tests.json" default to just `tools.json` and it shouldn't be merged.
- write-git-commit: Simplify
  - Do not recover from git errors. Print a warning / explanation and exit the workflow if unexpected error happens.
  - If session Id is not available, make it a configuration setup workflow. After setting up the session Id config, exit the workflow / tell user to start over
- Revise/improve sub-agent instructions per best practices
- run-and-fix-tests skill should:
  - Exit workflow after setting up configuration first time.
  - When exiting after setup, tell user to examine the build configuration and change as needed.
- run-and-fix-tests: Simplify
  - move agent delegation instructions in main skill. Just say "delegate to (sub-agent)" with instructions on what to pass to it.
  - remove / greatly reduce build-procedures and run-build reference files.
  - remove completion.md / simplify and move to main skill.
  - run-tests should reference sub-agent
- Feature: Run and Fix tests needs CI/CD mode that skips build/test output and just analyzes the failures directly (assuming they're available)
- Improve test line coverage > 90%
