Backlog:
- Some unit tests are probably overlapping and could be consolidated.
- Revise/improve sub-agent instructions per best practices

Nice-to-Have:
- Feature: Run and Fix tests needs CI/CD mode that skips build/test output and just analyzes the failures directly (assuming they're available)
- Improve test line coverage > 90%
