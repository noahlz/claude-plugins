Backlog:
- Revise/improve sub-agent instructions per best practices
- run-and-fix-tests test failure parsing should support both maven (surfire) and npm (tap)

Nice-to-Have:
- Improve test line coverage > 90%
- Feature: Run and Fix tests needs CI/CD mode that skips build/test output and just analyzes the failures directly (assuming they're available)
