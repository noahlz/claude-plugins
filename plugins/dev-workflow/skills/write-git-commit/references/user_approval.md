→ MUST use AskUserQuestion with these exact options:
  - "Accept this message?" (Recommended)
  - "Make changes"
  - "Stop/Cancel commit"

→ Handle user response:

✓ If "Accept this message?"
  - → Extract `COMMIT_SUBJECT` (first line)
  - → Extract `COMMIT_BODY` (remaining lines, may be empty)
  - → Proceed to section 2

✗ If "Make changes"
  - → Return to step 1c
  - → Regenerate message based on user feedback
  - → Return to step 1e (loop until approved or cancelled)

✗ If "Stop/Cancel commit"
  - → Exit workflow immediately
  - → Do NOT proceed to section 2
  - → Return control to user
